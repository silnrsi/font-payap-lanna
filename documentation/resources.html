    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>These fonts are supported by applications on all major operating systems (macOS, Windows, Linux-based, iOS, and Android), however the extent of that support depends on the individual OS and application. In particular, the application currently needs to support SIL’s <a href="https://graphite.sil.org">Graphite</a> rendering technology.</p>
    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
    <p>Install the fonts by decompressing the .zip archive and installing the fonts using the standard font installation process for .ttf (TrueType/OpenType) fonts for your platform. For additional tips see the help page on <a href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/installation">Font installation</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="keyboarding-and-character-set-support">Keyboarding and character set support</h2>
    <p>These fonts do not include keyboards or other software for entering text. To type the symbols in these fonts use the keyboarding systems provided in your OS or use a separate utility. SIL’s <a href="https://keyman.com/">Keyman</a> provides keyboards for over 2000 languages and works on all major desktop and mobile platforms. For information on other keyboarding options see the overview at <a href="https://scriptsource.org/entry/ytr8g8n6sw">Keyboard Systems Overview (ScriptSource)</a>.</p>
    <p>See <a href="charset.html">Character set support</a> for details of the Unicode support provided by these fonts.</p>
    <h2 id="rendering-and-application-support">Rendering and application support</h2>
    <p>These fonts currently support only Graphite shaping. OpenType code is in development but requires changes to external shaping engines. When those changes become mainstream an OpenType version will be released.</p>
    <h2 id="web-fonts">Web fonts</h2>
    <p>Web font versions of these fonts (in WOFF and WOFF2 formats) are available in the <code>web</code> folder. These can be copied to a web server and used as fonts on web pages. A very basic HTML/CSS demo page is also included. For more information on the options and techniques available for using these fonts on web pages see <a href="http://software.sil.org/fonts/webfonts">Using SIL Fonts on Web Pages</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="text-conversion">Text conversion</h2>
    <p>These fonts are encoded according to <a href="http://unicode.org">The Unicode Standard</a>. There may be future changes to Unicode that regularize the encoding for Tai Tham (Lanna). This project will be updated to track those changes.</p>
    <p>If you have text that uses a legacy, non-Unicode encoding there are tools that can help you convert that text for use with Unicode fonts. See <a href="https://scriptsource.org/entry/xlzd6n5aqt">Introduction to Text Conversion and Transliteration</a>.</p>
