#### *Why does this character sequence work in Graphite but not OpenType?*

Because of the differences in Graphite and OpenType technologies some character sequences may render differently, although the Graphite is most likely to render them correctly. Applications may also differ in their OpenType support. Please let us know if there is a sequence that is not rendering properly so we can try and fix it. Some bugs may be in the shaping systems rather than in the font and may be out of our control.
