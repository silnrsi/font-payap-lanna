Payap Lanna
===========

This file provides detailed information on the Payap Lanna Font Software. This information should be distributed along with the Payap Lanna and any derivative works.

## About this project

This project is intended to provide a free and open font family for all current languages and writing systems that use Tai Tham script of Northern Thailand. This font supports the Tai Tham script plus a range of useful Latin characters.

The design is inspired by, but not based on, the CR Udom fonts designed by Charin Jamjitt. It has been produced with help from [Payap's Linguistic Institute](http://li.payap.ac.th).

## ChangeLog

### 6 June 2022 (SIL WSTech Team) Payap Lanna version 1.000

First official release.

## Information for developers and contributors

We welcome other developers who wish to get involved in supporting and enhancing these fonts or who want to modify them.

SILâ€™s fonts are licensed according to the terms of the SIL Open Font License (https://scripts.sil.org/OFL). The OFL allows the fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. For details see the OFL.txt and OFL-FAQ.txt files in the package.

Full sources are included in this package. For information on the source formats or how the fonts are built see documentation/developer.html.
