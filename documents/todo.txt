## Font Design

- U+1A64 has too much of a loop on the bottom. It's basically a stick with a head on it. It is also too high? cf Burmese 102B/102C.
- U+1A7B is too curved. It is more vertical with a hook on the top.
- Give u1A58, u1A7A, u1A7A.high, u1A7B u1A7C advance width.
- u1AA2 is a continuous glyph with even more of a flourish.
. u1AAD the head is not a circle, it is an unclosed loop and it should be bigger, perhaps to the slight detriment of the lower bowl.
- u1AA9 looks too much like a full height u1A6A. OK it's subtle. But any blobiness needs to go on the left of the stem.
