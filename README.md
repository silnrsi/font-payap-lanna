# Payap Lanna [![Build Status](http://build.palaso.org/app/rest/builds/buildType:Fonts_PayapLanna/statusIcon)](http://build.palaso.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=Fonts_PayapLanna&guest=1)

This project is intended to provide a free and open font family for all current languages and writing systems that use Tai Tham script of Northern Thailand. This font supports the Tai Tham script plus a range of useful Latin characters.

The design is inspired by, but not based on, the CR Udom fonts designed by Charin Jamjitt. It has been produced with help from [Payap's Linguistic Institute](http://li.payap.ac.th).

To download the fonts visit the [Payap Lanna site](https://software.sil.org/payaplanna/) or the [Github releases page](https://github.com/silnrsi/font-payap-lanna/releases).
