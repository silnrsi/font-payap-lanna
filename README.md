# font-payap-lanna

Payap Lanna is a Unicode font family that supports Tai Tham in the Lanna style.

*Font design and engineering is still going on so this font is not yet ready for use or distribution yet.*

It is inspired but not derived from the Udom font family by Charin Jamjitt. 
It is an original design named after and produced with help from [Payap's Linguistic Institute](http://li.payap.ac.th).

The font source is available in [UFO version 3](http://unifiedfontobject.org/versions/ufo3/index.html).
The project is built using the Smith build system according to the specs in [wscript](wscript).
